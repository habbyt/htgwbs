        Abstract
  Navigational accidents in wintertime conditions occur relatively frequently, yet there is little systematic knowledge
   available about the circumstances under which these occur. This paper presents an analysis of navigational shipping
    accidents in the Northern Baltic Sea area which occurred in the period 2007–2013. The analysis is based on an
    integration of various data sources, aiming to reconstruct the accident conditions based on the best available
     data sources. Apart from basic accident information from the original accident databases, data from the Automatic
      Identification System is used to obtain insight in the operation type during which the accident occurred,
      as well as into other dynamic aspects of the accident scenario. Finally, atmospheric and sea ice data is used to
       reconstruct the navigational conditions under which the accidents occurred. The analysis aims to provide qualitative
        insights in patterns and outlier cases in the accidental conditions. Correspondingly, visual data mining is selected
         as analysis approach, because of its utility in obtaining qualitative knowledge from data sources through a
         combination of visualization techniques and human interaction with the data. Special attention is given to the strength
          of evidence of the identified accident patterns. The results are primarily useful for improving risk analyses focusing
           on oil spill risks in winter conditions and for developing realistic training scenarios for oil spill response operations.
